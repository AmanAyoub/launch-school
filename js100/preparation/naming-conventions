Naming Conventions

Use camelCase formatting for most variable and function names. Such names begin with a lowercase letter. If the name contains multiple words, each subsequent word should begin with an uppercase letter: let answerToUltimateQuestion = 42; 
Use uppercase names with underscores (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE) to represent constants that serve as unchanging configuration values in your program.
