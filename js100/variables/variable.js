// A variable is simply a name of storage location, we can store value in that location.
// Variable that doesn't have a specific value it initializes with a value of undefined.

let movie
console.log(movie); // returns undefined

// To assign a more useful value, we can reassign the value of movie:
movie = 'Cast Away'
console.log('My favorite movie is ' + movie); // returns My favorite movie is Cast Away
