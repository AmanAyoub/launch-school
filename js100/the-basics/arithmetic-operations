Arithmetic Operations

Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying numbers
Use the + operator to perform addition:
> 38 + 4
= 42

Subtraction uses the '-' operator:

> 44 - 2
= 42


Multiplication uses the * operator:

> 7 * 6
= 42

Division and Remainder
You can divide two numbers—integers or decimals—with the / operator:

> 16 / 4
= 4

> 16 / 2.5
= 6.4

When you divide two integers that don't result in a whole number, you get a decimal number in the result:

> 16 / 5
= 3.2

> 16 / 7
= 2.2857142857142856

Remainder operator, %. It returns the remainder of a division operation:

> 16 % 4
= 0

> 16 % 5
= 1
