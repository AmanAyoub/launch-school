Infinity and -Infinity

Infinity is a number that is so large, it can't be written down. If you start counting 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, saying a new number every second and keep going for the next 37 trillion years, you will not ever reach the value of Infinity. There is always a larger value:

> 1 / 0
= Infinity

Returns Infinity, which indicates a number of infinite magnitude.
Infinity has a negative counterpart, -Infinity, that represents an infinite value that is less than 0. It most commonly arises when dividing a negative number by 0:

> -1 / 0
= -Infinity

As with NaN, Infinity and -Infinity are considered by JavaScript to be numbers.
