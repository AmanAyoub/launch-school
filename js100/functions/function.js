// most languages have a structure called a procedure that lets you extract the code and run it as a separate unit. 
// In JavaScript, we call these procedures functions.

// Here's a function named sayBye:
function sayBye() {
	console.log("Bye Aman");
}

// To access the function:
sayBye(); // returns Bye Aman
